## About UBot

UBot is an open source platform for developing chat bots. It provides consistent apis for different platforms (telegram,
discord and more!) in a language-independent way, making bot development WORA-able (Write once, Run anywhere).

## About UBot.Common.Kotlin

This library provides a lot of helper functions for writing UBot Components (Account / App) with Kotlin JVM (other
languages on JVM may be ok, but it will be troublesome since this project use Kotlin Coroutines a lot).

## Usage

It's strongly recommended to use this package with [JitPack](https://jitpack.io/)
